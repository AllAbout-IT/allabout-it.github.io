<img src="Profile.png" alt=Profile style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" width="160" height="128"><div style="width: 100%; text-align: justify; margin-top: -10px;"><span style="font-size: 2em; font-weight: bold; float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-top: -14px">DevOps</span><p>plays a crucial role in breaking down the boundaries between development and operations, automating the development, deployment, and operation of numerous entities and services, and continuously improving them. This process is similar to creating and presenting music. For instance, a composer creates dozens or hundreds of sounds to make a song on a score, while a conductor ensures that these sounds produce beautiful music from the performers. The music production process, from composition to recording, mixing, and mastering, is also similar, as it involves systematic execution and continuous improvement, leading to the creation of highly polished works.</p>

<div style="width: 100%; text-align: justify;">Drawing on my extensive experience as a band leader, composer, and performer in the music industry, I am confident that I can apply my vision and creativity to the DevOps role. Both music production and DevOps involve complex elements that require creative problem-solving. Collaboration and coordination are also essential for success in both fields. The knowledge and experience I have acquired from my music career can be applied to achieve high levels of performance in DevOps. Therefore, I am committed to achieving results through passion and hard work in the DevOps field.
