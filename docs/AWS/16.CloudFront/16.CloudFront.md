## CDN

CDN stands for "Content Delivery Network", which refers to a technology that uses globally distributed server networks to deliver website and application content quickly and reliably. Originally developed to address bandwidth constraints and latency issues associated with downloading large files over the internet, CDN has become an essential technology for delivering content quickly on websites and applications.

AWS CloudFront is one of the CDN services, which is a cloud-based CDN service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). With various features and a globally distributed network of edge locations, AWS CloudFront optimizes website and application performance and provides reliable service.

## Definition  

AWS CloudFront is a global Content Delivery Network (CDN) service that provides a reliable and secure way to deliver static and dynamic web content, video, applications, and APIs faster over the internet.

CloudFront caches content at the edge location closest to the client, minimizing response time. This improves website and application performance, reduces bandwidth usage, and decreases server load, resulting in cost savings on server capacity and infrastructure.

CloudFront integrates easily with various web servers and services. It can be used with AWS services such as S3, EC2, Lambda, Elastic Load Balancing, Route 53, as well as external web servers, video, and streaming platforms.

CloudFront offers various caching features, such as browser caching, edge caching, and hub caching, which help minimize content delivery time and bandwidth usage.

Furthermore, CloudFront ensures security through SSL/TLS certificates and encryption. AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall) can also be used to enhance website and application security.

Finally, CloudFront offers flexible pricing based on usage. Costs are based on the amount of data used, edge location, and HTTPS fees, among others.

## Role  

* **Content caching**  
CloudFront caches content from the edge location closest to the client to minimize response time. This can improve the performance of websites and applications, reduce bandwidth usage, and reduce server load, thereby reducing server capacity and infrastructure costs.

* **Integration**  
CloudFront easily integrates with a variety of web servers and services. Available in conjunction with AWS services such as AWS S3, EC2, Lambda, Elastic Load Balancing, and Route 53, as well as external web servers, video and streaming platforms.

* **Caching capabilities**  
CloudFront offers a variety of caching capabilities. Minimize content delivery time and bandwidth usage using a variety of caching strategies, including browser caching, edge caching, and hub caching.

* **Security**  
CloudFront ensures security with SSL/TLS certificates and encryption. AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF) can also enhance website and application security.

* **Flexible Rate System**  
CloudFront charges flexibly based on usage. Cost is determined by the amount of data used, edge location, HTTPS charges, etc.

## Function  

* **CloudFront's Global Edge Network**
  * CloudFront provides a global content delivery network with distributed edge locations worldwide.
  * Enables faster and more reliable content delivery by caching content at edge locations and sending it to nearby clients.
  * CloudFront enables fast content delivery, ensures high availability, and provides a fast experience for global users.

* **Static/dynamic content delivery**
  * CloudFront can deliver both static and dynamic content.
  * It caches static content (image, CSS, JS, etc.) to near-edge locations to minimize transmission time and bandwidth usage, and enables dynamic content (API, application, etc.) to be immediately imported and cached from the origin server.

* **Origin Selection**
  * CloudFront supports multiple originals, and you can select the origin to import content.
  * In addition to the default behavior for the origin server, CloudFront uses the Origin Groups feature to create a single DNS name pointing to multiple origin to perform failover.

* Failover through Origin group
  * CloudFront uses the Origin Groups feature to easily switch to another origin server in the event of a failure on the origin server.
  * In the event of a failure, CloudFront overrides all requests to the origin server to prevent service interruption.

* **SSL support**
  * CloudFront supports SSL/TLS to ensure the security of content delivery.
  * CloudFront uses a signed SSL/TLS certificate and supports client-side SSL/TLS termination and SSL/TLS connections between the origin server.

* **Access Control**
  * CloudFront supports access control for users. AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) allows you to manage permissions between AWS resources and users.
  * You can also set up access control for content through signed URLs/cookies, Origin Access Identity (OAI), etc.

* **Security**
  * CloudFront protects content from DDoS attacks with SSL/TLS encryption and AWS Shield.
  * You can also work with AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF) to increase the security of websites and applications.

* **Cost-effectiveness**
  * CloudFront charges flexibly based on usage. Charges are made for the use of data transfers, HTTP requests, HTTPS requests, Lambda@Edge, etc.
  * There is no data transfer charge between AWS services, so you can work with other AWS services to optimize costs.

## Ordering of operation

1. When the client calls the CloudFront domain name, the DNS server returns the IP address for CloudFront.

2. When a client's request reaches CloudFront, the CloudFront edge server processes the request and checks for content in the edge cache that is closest to the client.

3. If there is content in the edge cache, it returns the content from the edge cache and sends it to the client. This minimizes response time to requests from clients.

4. If there is no content in the edge cache, the CloudFront edge server forwards the client's request to the Origin server.

5. The Origin server generates the appropriate response at the request of the client and returns it to the CloudFront edge server.

6. The CloudFront edge server stores new content in the edge cache and returns it to the client. This allows content to be transferred faster from the edge cache the next time the same content is requested.

7. If the content stored in the edge cache is no longer valid, CloudFront imports the new content from the Origin server and stores it in the edge cache. This process occurs when the content expires or the content is updated on the Origin server.

8. CloudFront can be used in conjunction with other AWS services, in which case CloudFront can import new content from the Origin server through events that occur.

## Security  

* **SSL/TLS support**  
CloudFront encrypts data using the SSL/TLS protocol. CloudFront supports SSL/TLS encryption for communication between a user's browser and CloudFront endpoints and also between endpoints.

* **Origin Access Identity (OAI)**  
OAI enhances the security of S3 buckets or other origin servers associated with CloudFront. With OAI, CloudFront endpoints can access S3 buckets using temporary security credentials generated by CloudFront, instead of directly accessing them.

* **AWS WAF**  
CloudFront can be integrated with AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall), which protects applications from malicious traffic and prevents attacks such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).

* **Signed URLs/Cookies**  
CloudFront provides access control using signed URLs and signed cookies. This feature allows restricting access to specific resources and limiting access to a specific time period.

* **DDoS protection**  
CloudFront provides DDoS protection at the network and application layer, defending against attacks. CloudFront integrates with Amazon CloudWatch and AWS Shield to provide advanced DDoS protection.

* **AWS PrivateLink**  
AWS PrivateLink allows secure access to AWS services such as CloudFront, S3 buckets, EC2 instances, and ELB within a VPC. This avoids data transmission over the internet and provides complete control over data traffic within the VPC.
