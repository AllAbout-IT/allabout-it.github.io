## Introducing AWS Cloud WAN  

 AWS announced the preview release of a new networking service, AWS Cloud WAN. Cloud WAN is a managed wide area networking (WAN) service that makes it easy for you to build, manage, and monitor a global network that connects resources running across your cloud and on-premises environments.Cloud WAN provides an easy way to connect your data centers, branch offices, and cloud resources into a unified, centrally managed network, reducing the operational cost and complexity involved with running a global network.

## Primary use cases for AWS Cloud WAN

### Global Connectivity  

AWS Cloud WAN can be used to establish global connectivity between different regions and offices. It allows you to create a global network that spans multiple regions, providing fast and secure connectivity between your resources and users.

### Branch Office Connectivity

AWS Cloud WAN can also be used to connect your branch offices to your AWS resources. It provides a secure, reliable, and high-performance connection between your branch offices and your cloud resources.

### Data Center Connectivity  

You can use AWS Cloud WAN to connect your on-premises data centers to your AWS resources. This provides a hybrid networking solution that allows you to leverage the scalability and flexibility of the cloud while still maintaining control over your on-premises infrastructure.

### Network Segmentation

AWS Cloud WAN can also be used to segment your network into different virtual private clouds (VPCs). This allows you to isolate different workloads and applications for better security and compliance.

### Disaster Recovery  

AWS Cloud WAN can be used to create disaster recovery (DR) solutions that are geographically dispersed. You can use AWS Cloud WAN to replicate your data and applications to different regions for improved availability and resilience in case of a disaster

## The main concept  

### AWS NEtwork Manager  

The user interface in the AWS Management Console and associated APIs to centrally manage your global network.  

### Global Network  

A single private network that acts as the root-level container for your network objects. A global network can contain both Transit Gateways and a Core Network

### Core Network

The part of your global network managed by AWS

### Core Network Policy  

A single, versioned policy document which defines all aspects of your core network

### Attachments  

Any connections or resources you want to add to your core network. Supported attachments include VPCs, VPNs, and [Connect](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/network-manager/latest/cloudwan/cloudwan-create-attachment.html#cloudwan-connect-attachment) attachments

### Core Network Edge (CNE)

A Regional connection point for your attachments as defined in the policy. Under the hood, Cloud WAN is using technology similar to Transit Gateway. Itâ€™s managed by AWS, but there are differences (dynamic routing is one example).

### Network Segments

Routing domains that by default only allow communication within a segment, consistently throughout the global network. These are strongly enforced layer 3 routing domains (unless you create sharing relationships in your network policy).
