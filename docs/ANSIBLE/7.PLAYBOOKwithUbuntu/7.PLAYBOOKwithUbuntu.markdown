## What different things when you operate centOS, Ubuntu by using Ansible

### 1. Package Management System

* CentOS uses YUM package manager
* Ubuntu uses APT package manager
* Different modules should be used in playbook for package installation/removal: "yum" for CentOS and "apt" for Ubuntu

### 2. Default Locations of System Resources

* Default locations of configuration files, log files, and other system resources may differ
* Example: Default location for Apache web server configuration file in
  * CentOS
    * /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
  * Ubuntu
    * /etc/apache2/apache2.conf  

### 3. Differences in Names of Services, Users, and Groups

* Services, users, and groups may have different names between CentOS and Ubuntu
* Example: Apache web server service is named "httpd" in CentOS and "apache2" in Ubuntu

### 4. Use of Root Privileges

* By default, root account is enabled in CentOS, but disabled in Ubuntu
* To perform operations with root privileges on Ubuntu, use "become" option in Ansible playbook to elevate privileges using "sudo" command
* In CentOS, root privileges are enabled by default, so no need to elevate privileges separately

### 5. Conclusion

When creating an Ansible playbook to operate CentOS and Ubuntu, take these differences into account and adjust the commands and modules accordingly.
