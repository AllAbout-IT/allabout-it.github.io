## IGP and EGP

IGP and EGP are two types of routing protocols used in computer networking. IGP stands for Interior Gateway Protocol, and EGP stands for Exterior Gateway Protocol.

Definition:

IGP: An IGP is a protocol used for routing within an autonomous system (AS), which is a network of routers under a single administrative domain.
EGP: An EGP is a protocol used for routing between different autonomous systems.
Structure:

IGP: An IGP is a type of intra-domain routing protocol, which means it operates within a single autonomous system. Examples of IGPs include OSPF (Open Shortest Path First), IS-IS (Intermediate System to Intermediate System), and RIP (Routing Information Protocol).
EGP: An EGP is a type of inter-domain routing protocol, which means it operates between different autonomous systems. Examples of EGP include BGP (Border Gateway Protocol).
Function:

IGP: IGPs are used to determine the best path for routing data within a single autonomous system. These protocols use metrics such as hop count, bandwidth, delay, and reliability to determine the optimal path.
EGP: EGPs are used to determine the best path for routing data between different autonomous systems. These protocols use policies and rules to determine the optimal path.
Difference:

The main difference between IGP and EGP is the scope of their operation. IGPs operate within a single autonomous system, while EGPs operate between different autonomous systems.
IGPs use metrics such as hop count, bandwidth, delay, and reliability to determine the best path, while EGPs use policies and rules to determine the best path.
Examples of IGPs include OSPF, IS-IS, and RIP, while examples of EGPs include BGP.
In summary, IGPs are used for routing within a single autonomous system, while EGPs are used for routing between different autonomous systems. IGPs use metrics such as hop count, bandwidth, delay, and reliability to determine the best path, while EGPs use policies and rules.
